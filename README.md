## Instructions
Complete the following steps:
 
 1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json`.

 2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
    * Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.
    * Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.
    * Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

    * Use `otu_ids` for the x values.
    * Use `sample_values` for the y values.
    * Use `sample_values` for the marker size.
    * Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.
    * Use `otu_labels` for the text values.

  7. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.
  
## Advanced Challenge Assignment
 * Adapt the Gauge Chart from [https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/](https://plotly.com/javascript/gauge-charts/) to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
 * You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.
 * Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

## File Organization and Structure
* Located in the parent directory are three folders and the [index.html](https://github.com/tallantj95/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/index.html) file.
* The [Resources](https://github.com/tallantj95/belly-button-challenge/tree/main/Resources) folder contains the [samples.json](https://github.com/tallantj95/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/Resources/samples.json) file as a reference.
* The [assets](https://github.com/tallantj95/belly-button-challenge/tree/main/assets) folder contains a [css](https://github.com/tallantj95/belly-button-challenge/tree/main/assets/css) folder which houses the [styles.css](https://github.com/tallantj95/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/assets/css/styles.css) file used for customization of the dashboard.
* The [static](https://github.com/tallantj95/belly-button-challenge/tree/main/static/js) folder contains the two javascript files [app.js](https://github.com/tallantj95/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/static/js/app.js) and [bonus.js](https://github.com/tallantj95/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/static/js/bonus.js) that were used to build the dashboard.
